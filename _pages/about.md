I am a postdoctoral scholar in geophysics at [Caltech Seismolab](https://www.seismolab.caltech.edu/) working with [Prof. Zhongwen Zhan](https://seismolab.caltech.edu/zhan_z.html). I am currently exploring the **distributed acoustic sensing** (**DAS**) technology to study the high-resolution earthquake source process and shallow surface structure. 

Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree in geophysics at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/) advised by [Prof. Yingcai Zheng](https://uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/people/faculty/yingcai-zheng/) in 2020, and my B.S degree at [Peking Univesity](https://sess2.pku.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in 2015.

My current research is focused on developing noval methods for exploring the **DAS** dataset, and providing solutions to seismic monitoring of **carbon sequestration and storage**, exploiting **geothermal** energy reservoirs, and **geological engineering safety** for green energy sources such as offshore wind farms. The goal is to achieve a zero-carbon sustainable energy pattern.

Research Interests
======
I am an observational seismologist with broad research interests ranging from shallow surface to deep earth. During my Ph.D. the the University of Houston, I have been working on the deep earthquakes and earth mantle. My research work on deep earthquakes solved a [50 year old puzzle](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0197-2). During my internships in the industry and national lab, I have been working on various research projects including modeling seismic wave propagation in fractured medium, microseismic monitoring for CO2-EOR field, and moment tensor inversion for meso-scale hydraulic fracture experiments. 

Speciafically, my research interests can be summarized into three aspects:
* **Distributed Acoustic Sensing**: 
  - Earthquake rupture imaging with DAS
  - Focal mechanism inversion with DAS
  - Seismicity monitoring with DAS
* **Reservoir**
  - Machine learning fracture characterization
  - Seismic wave propagation in fractured medium
  - Microseismic monitoring
  - Waveform-based moment tensor inversion with 3D velocity models
* **Deep Earth**
  - Deep earthquakes and Subducting slab anisotropy
  - Mantle mixing
